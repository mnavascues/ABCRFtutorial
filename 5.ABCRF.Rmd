## Limitations of classical ABC

The classical approaches in ABC that we have explored present two application challenges: 

* Trade-off between number of simulations and tolerance (only partially solved by regression ABC)
* Choice of summary statistics: which and how many to add? are they informative? See also: [curse of dimensionality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality).

The use of Random forests in ABC has
